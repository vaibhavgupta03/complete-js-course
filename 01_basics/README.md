## Variables and Constant
- Variables are used to store values in memory.
- Variables are created when you assign a value to it.
- Variables are declared using var, let or const keywords
- Variables declared using var and let keywords can be changed
- Variables declared using const keyword cannot be changed
- Variables declared using var keyword are function scoped
- Variables declared using let keyword are block scoped

- Note:-
Prefer not to use var
because of issue in block scope and functional scope.
var is hoisted at the top of its containing function, but initialized with undefined.
let is not initialized.
const is not initialized and cannot be reassigned.
