# JavaScript Basics

## Comments in JavaScript
- Single line comments are created using //
- Multi line comments are created using /* and */

```javascript
// This is a single line comment
/* This is a
multi line comment */
```

## Variables and Constant
- Variables are used to store values in memory.
- Variables are created when you assign a value to it.
- Variables are declared using var, let or const keywords
- Variables declared using var and let keywords can be changed
- Variables declared using const keyword cannot be changed
- Variables declared using var keyword are function scoped
- Variables declared using let keyword are block scoped

### Note:-
Prefer not to use var
because of issue in block scope and functional scope.<br/>
var is hoisted at the top of its containing function, but initialized with undefined.<br/>
let is not initialized.
const is not initialized and cannot be reassigned.

## Data Types
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language
- JavaScript has 7 data types
- 6 primitive data types
- 1 reference data type
- Primitive data types are
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol
- BigInt
- Reference data type is
- Object
- Array
- Functions

## Type Conversion
- Type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another
- Type conversion can be implicit or explicit
- Implicit type conversion is done automatically by JavaScript
- Explicit type conversion is done manually by the programmer

## Operators
- Operators are used to perform operations on operands
- Operands can be variables or values
- Operators are classified into
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators

- Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations
- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
- Comparison operators are used to compare two values
- Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements
- Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations

## Conditionals
- Conditionals are used to execute a block of code based on a condition
- Conditionals are created using if, else if and else keywords
- Conditionals are created using switch and case keywords
